Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because your local environment is most likely your working environment and you would rather not have git make changes
when you are working on a section of code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork allow you to clone another project directly on Github while maintaining a link to the original project
Clones are copies or repositories that are independent of the original repo
Branches are an offshoot of a repo that allows you to work on something specific without messing woth your "production" code
