What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It adds the .git file and creates a repo so you can start commiting to git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is user driven which allows a user to determine the logical commits they would make to git.
This will make you commits and commit history more logical and easies to read
