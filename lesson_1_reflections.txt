How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It allowed me to easily see where changes were made in my code.
that was working perviously which allowed me to resolve it quickly.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

I can quickly go back and check old code and how I did things.
Also if I want to revert changes it would be very simple.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

It introduces human error but you will have logical easier to read commits

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because Git deals with coding which requires code to come from multiple locations where google docs deals in a single document that will be updated as it is changed.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

I know I can revert back to a working version easily
